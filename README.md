# Pi-Day
**In honor of Pi Day, a bit of code that gives you as much π as you want**

I wanted to put a link here where you could run this code interactively online, but the only online tool I found that lets you run Ruby interactively requires a subscription.  The trial page worked great, but said it would expire.

[This link has probably expired but might let you have π in your browser](https://coderpad.io/ZQJ6JKJ7)
